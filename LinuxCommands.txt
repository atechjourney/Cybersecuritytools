// Commands for Log Operations 
Cat ("concatenate")
is a simple utility that reads one or more files and displays its content in the terminal. When used for log files, it prints the entire log content to the screen.

Less 
The less command is an improvement over cat when dealing with larger files. It allows you to view the file's data page by page, providing a more convenient way to read through lengthy logs. When using less to open a file, it displays the first page by default, and you can scroll down using the arrow keys or with Page Up and Page Down.

Trail 
The tail command is specifically designed for viewing the end of files and is very useful for seeing a summary of recently generated events in the case of log files.
The most common use of tail is coupled with the -f option, which allows you to "follow" the log file in real-time, as it continuously updates the terminal with new log entries as they are generated and written. 
This is extremely useful when monitoring logs for live events or real-time system behavior.
By default, tail will only display the last ten lines of the file. However, we can change this with the -n option and specify the number of lines we want to view.

wc
The wc (word count) command is a simple but powerful utility that can be quite useful for quick analysis and statistics gathering. 
The output of wc provides information about the number of lines, words, and characters in a log file. 
This can help security analysts understand the size and volume of log data they are dealing with before diving into a more detailed analysis.

cut
The cut command extracts specific columns (fields) from files based on specified delimiters. This is a handy command for working with log files that have structured or tab-separated data.
If we want to extract all of the IP addresses in the file, we can use the cut command to specify a delimiter of a space character and only select the first field returned.
