Special Characters
Certain characters are reserved in ELK queries and must be escaped before usage. Reserved characters in ELK include +, -, =, &&, ||, &, | and !.

For instance, using the + character in a query will result in an error; to escape this character, precede it with a backslash (e.g. \+).
