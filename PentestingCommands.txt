// Linux Commands 

ls ( ls is short for list)

user@Usercomputer ~$ ls ( This will show a list of files on the users computer)

adding these to the end of ls will allow you to manipulate the list in different ways: 

1. -a (shows the files and permissions, user owner, group owner, last modified/created date)

2. -l-l ("Long Listing" shows the files inside of the directories or the list of folder)

3. -R (files sorted by file size)

4. -S (List of only directories)
